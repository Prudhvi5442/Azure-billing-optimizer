# Azure Billing Optimizer ‚Äì Serverless Cost Optimization Project

## üìò Overview

This project provides a practical implementation of a **serverless cost optimization architecture** using **Azure Cosmos DB**, **Azure Functions**, and **Python**.

### ‚úÖ Objective

To reduce costs in a read-heavy Cosmos DB workload by **archiving old billing records** (older than 3 months) to a lower-cost container while preserving availability.

---

## üöÄ Architecture

- **Serverless**: Azure Function with Timer trigger
- **Database**: Cosmos DB (original + archive containers)
- **Infrastructure**: ARM template for full resource provisioning
- **Automation**: Timer-based data archival (no manual trigger required)

## üß± Architecture Diagram

This diagram illustrates the serverless architecture used to optimize billing records by archiving data older than 3 months to reduce storage cost.

## ‚è∞ Function Logic

- Triggered every **hour**
- Connects to primary Cosmos DB container
- Moves billing records **older than 90 days** to an **archive container**
- Deletes archived records from the original container

## ‚úÖ Constraints Met

| Constraint                  | Status  |
|----------------------------|---------|
| No downtime                | ‚úÖ Yes  |
| No data loss               | ‚úÖ Yes  |
| No API contract changes    | ‚úÖ Yes  |
| Simplicity                 | ‚úÖ Yes  |
| Serverless & scalable      | ‚úÖ Yes  |
